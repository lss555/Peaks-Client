# Peaks client: A Description

This application allows the user to make an account and log peaks that they've climbed, hiked, or ran.  It offers a secure log in process and the user can make, edit, delete, and view there peaks and see peaks from other users as well.  It acts as a digital "peak journal" for the user.

## Planning Story

I originally planned to make the application to only be able to view the owners peaks but later decided to make it able to views everyones peaks and descriptions because I think that's alot funner because I would be stoked to see how Jeff climbed xyz peak and what thought about it.  To plan I used the old but reliable post it notes to plan each action and how I wanted to work and then just completed each action one by one.

### User Stories

As a user I want to be able to log the peak name
As a user I want to be able to log the distance hiked/climbed/ran (can clump as 1 distance traveled in miles)
As a user I want to be able to sign up
As a user I want to be able to sign in and view my peaks stats
As a user I want to be able to view other peoples stats

### Technologies Used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript

### Unsolved Problems

- Still I would like to make usernames so you can view who logged peaks and there description
- Eventually I would like to make it so you can add images to your peaks.
